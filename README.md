# LMSWA - LM Studio Web Front-End for mobile devices

## Disclaimer

This is a fork and 99.9% of all work was done by [techcow2](https://github.com/techcow2). I was in need of talking to my local LM Studio via my phone and found [the original repository](https://github.com/techcow2/lmsa) which I've expanded by essentially wrapping a webserver around the source code to serve it via HTTP to make it available in my iPhone's web browser.
